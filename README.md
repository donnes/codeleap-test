## About the development

### Structure

I choose to use a [boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser) that I have been used for a while. This boilerplate uses Typescript and [MoX-State-Tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/) instead of Redux.

### Tests

Were made unit tests of MST models and stores. Quite simple and not too much sophisticated but I think that coverages the major implementations.

### Improvements

I think a lot of improvements can be done like **form validations**, **empty states**, **error messages**, **user logout**, etc.

## Thanks

In advance, I want to thank you Codeleap for the opportunity. I enjoyed the conversation and to build this coding test.
